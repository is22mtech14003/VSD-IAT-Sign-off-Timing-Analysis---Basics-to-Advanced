[Static timing analysis (STA)](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-static-timing-analysis.html) is a method of validating the timing performance of a design by checking all possible paths for timing violations. STA breaks a design down into timing paths, calculates the signal propagation delay along each path, and checks for violations of timing constraints inside the design and at the input/output interface. The workshop covers all the basic concepts in STA and Timing constraints.

## Timing path Elements
- Startpoint
- 
Typically startpoint is data pin or input pin where data is available

- Endpoint
where data is captured by clock edge

or where the data must be avaiable at a specific time

generaly output pin or register data pin
